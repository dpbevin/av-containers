# Taking the lid off containers
Supporting materials for the August 2019 TechTopics session.

> In short, the microservice *architectural style* is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.

For the full article, read Martin Fowler's post here: https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html
